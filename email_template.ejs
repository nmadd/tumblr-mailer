  <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
  <p>
    How are you doing? It's been <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> 
    since we last talked. I recently started learning to code at Fullstack Academy and have been blogging about my experiences.

    You can check out my most recent posts here:
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>

    This has been an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.
